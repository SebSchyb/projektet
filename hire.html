                <h3>Hire a Guru</h3>
                <p>It is possible when making a reservation to also hire one of our Board Game Gurus.

                    Our dedicated Game Gurus can introduce you to many of the games in our selection, and guide you
                    through the rules. A
                    Game Guru costs 550 DKK per hour. If you are a member there is a 40% discount lowering the price to
                    330 DKK per hour.
                    Only the booker needs to be a member to get the discount

                    If the dedicated Guru(s) should know specific genre of games or be able to speak Danish, please say
                    so in the comments.
                    We cant guarantee that the Guru know the rules to a specific game, but then the guru will try to
                    find something
                    similar. And even though the Guru might know the rules for a specific game, we might not have it or
                    it might not be
                    available if other guests are playing it. Games can unfortunately not be reserved

                    The Guru is booked from the time the reservation starts unless other is asked for in the comments.

                    Book the guru here</p>

                <h3>Bastard to Go</h3>
                <p>Do we ever take gaming beyond the walls of the café? Yes we do. We have been at Roskilde Festival in
                    Dream City (a
                    chilled part of the camping area) It has been hugely popular and helped us on our quest to infect
                    the world with
                    boardgaming, we have also attended Copenhell (Denmarks largest metal music festival) and other
                    conventions. Apart from
                    that were sometimes doing board game events around Copenhagen (and beyond) for companies,
                    libraries, organisations and
                    everything in between.

                    Does this mean that I can get you to come and introduce games at my place? Yes!

                    If youre an employee organising a game day at your company, an eccentric millionaire wanting to do
                    a unique game event
                    on top of Mount Everest or just a guy/girl with a great idea, then request Games n Gurus To Go by
                    filling out the form
                    found here and lets hear about it. At the moment were super busy building up the café at
                    Huset-KBH, so we cant
                    promise that we have the time. But you never know we will do what we can to help you out.</p>
